# Project Plan: The Virtual Queueing App

## Vision

Our vision is to become the **"SnapScan of queueing"**. We are building an incredibly simple, intuitive, and fast way for users to join and manage their place in a queue using their phones. The primary goal is to create a frictionless experience that promotes high user engagement and satisfaction.

## Core Functionality

The application revolves around two main user types: Businesses and Users.

-   **Businesses**:
    -   Can create and manage multiple queues for their services (e.g., a checkout line, a service desk, a restaurant waitlist).
    -   Each queue is represented by a unique, scannable QR code.
    -   Can display queue status on a public screen.

-   **Users**:
    -   Scan a business's QR code with their phone to instantly see queue details.
    -   Can join a queue with a single tap.
    -   Receive real-time status updates, including their position in the queue and the estimated wait time.
    -   Can leave the queue at any time.

## Future Roadmap

This project is designed for growth. The long-term roadmap includes several key enhancements:

1.  **Distinct User Interfaces**:
    -   **`business-ui`**: A dedicated interface for businesses to manage their queues, view analytics, and configure settings.
    -   **`user-ui`**: A public-facing application for end-users to interact with queues.

2.  **Family Features**:
    -   Allow a single user (e.g., a parent) to join a queue on behalf of multiple people (e.g., a family), occupying multiple slots but managed by one device.

3.  **Advanced Queue Management**:
    -   Provide businesses with powerful tools, such as customer notifications ("It's your turn soon!"), queue analytics, and peak time analysis.

4.  **Backend Integration**:
    -   Phase out the initial mock adapters and integrate with real, scalable backend services for authentication, database management, and real-time communication.
