# Agent Protocol & Work Log

---

## Agent Protocol (Mandatory)

All agents contributing to this repository **must** follow these steps before starting work:

1.  **Review `tasks.md`**: Identify an open task from the list of actionable items.
2.  **Review `plan.md`**: Understand how your assigned task fits into the broader, long-term project vision.
3.  **Review `architecture.md`**: Ensure your proposed changes strictly adhere to the defined Ports and Adapters architecture. Do not introduce dependencies that violate the separation of concerns.
4.  **Review this file (`agents.md`)**: Check the "Work Log" below to understand the context of recent changes and avoid duplicating effort.
5.  **Update Logs**: After successfully completing and merging your work, add a new entry to the "Work Log" detailing your changes.
