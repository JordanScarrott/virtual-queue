# Headless Virtual Queueing Application

This repository contains the core business logic for a modern, headless virtual queueing application. The system is designed to provide a simple and intuitive way for users to join and manage their place in a queue via their mobile devices, while giving businesses powerful tools to manage customer flow.

The project is built with **Deno** and **TypeScript**. It strictly follows a **Headless, Ports and Adapters (Hexagonal)** architecture to ensure a clean separation between the core application logic and external technologies like UIs and backend services.
